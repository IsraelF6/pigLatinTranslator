======================
 Pig Latin Translator
======================

Made By: Israel Felhandler

This program has a function which takes a string as a parameter and returns the pig latin version of that string. 
The program is able to handle punctuation, ignore numbers, as well as handle multiple sentences.
There is also a small driver function which tests the outcome of the functions for correctness.


Pig Lating: takes the first letter of a "word" and appends it to the end and adds "ay" to the end as well.
EX: "hello" --> "ellohay"

EX:
if string = "Alex, how did you do question 21?"
after passing through function, it should translate to 
“lexAay, owhay idday ouyay oday uestionqay 21?”
